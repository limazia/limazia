## Hey there, I'm Acacio 👋

As a software engineer with over 3 years of experience, I bring a team-oriented approach to delivering high-quality, performance-driven solutions through technology. My passion for creating things began when I was young, writing my first program at just 11 years old. Inspired by my love for Combat Arms and Crossfire, I learned C++ and started programming hacks (lol). That journey led me to where I am today, building amazing things with JavaScript (and TypeScript). 🤖
